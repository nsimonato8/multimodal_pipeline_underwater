Structure Description:
- The Main was built entirely of iron with original dimensions of approximately 106.1 x 12.2 m and a registered gross tonnage of 3,087 GRT.
- The design of the steamer followed a clipper bow, a very elegant feature still popular at the time thought to be for speed and to give visual and functional momentum to the hull.
- She was powered by a steam engine, which after a modernization in 1878 was capable of developing about 3,000 horsepower steam to achieve a service speed of about 14 knots.
- She could accommodate about 70 passengers in first class, 100 in second class, and 600 in third class.

Historical facts:
- The steamship SS Main (I) was built in 1868 for the German company Norddeutscher Lloyd at the Greenock shipyards. 
- The liner plied the Atlantic for over twenty years before passing under the British flag and then ending her fate in the Azores in 1892 in Porto Pim Bay on Faial Island.
- However, despite the modernization carried out ten years after her inauguration, as early as 1881 the steamer began to lose competitiveness compared to other vessels, to such an extent that she was then sold in 1891 to the Anglo-American Steamship Co.
- In November 1892, the SS Main, by then under British flag, was sailing in the North Atlantic with a cargo mainly of cotton and cattle bound for Liverpool.
- While underway aboard the Main, a fire broke out and she was diverted to the nearby port of Horta on Faial Island.
- Despite rescue operations that saved the crew, the fire remained untamed.
- The first archaeological investigation of the site was in 1999 on behalf of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, but only subsequent investigations in 2016 and 2022 allowed detailed mapping of the site and certainty in the identification of the wreck's remains with those of the steamship Main (contrary to a local oral tradition that identified the wreck's remains as those of a merchant ship engaged in inter-insular traffic).

Current status of the wreck:
- The depth of the site is very shallow, lying between 3.5 and 8.5 meters. 
- The shallow depth, combined with the relative clarity of the bay's waters under favorable conditions, makes the wreck visible even from the surface. 
- Currently, the remains of the Main extend for a length of more than 100 meters. 
- Much of the port side is believed to have collapsed northward and is now buried beneath the sandy seabed; its location is suggested by an alignment of remnants of the beams (the crossbeams that supported the bridges) emerging from the sand. 
- Despite the structural collapse, a significant portion of the hull's outer planking is still present and identifiable. 
- The current state of the wreck is therefore that of a collapsed metal structure partially dismantled by natural agents, but one that still retains considerable extent and planimetric integrity, as well as key structural elements. 
- The partial burial of some sections may have helped to better preserve them from marine action.
